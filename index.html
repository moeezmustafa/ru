        <h2>Forever Yours</h2>
        <p>
       Rania, my love,

Happy birthday, my beautiful girl. It just turned midnight for you, and somewhere between Belgium and Pakistan there is this soft invisible thread pulling our worlds close. I wish I was there to hold your hand, to see your face in the warm candlelight, to tease you softly and then kiss your forehead until you get shy. One day I will. One day distance will be nothing but an old story we laugh about. For now, I give you this little universe I built for you, from the same part of my heart where you live every day.

You’re stepping into a new year of your life, and I want one truth to sit deep in your chest. You are chosen. You are loved. You are safe with me. Whatever the world throws at you, whatever essays, exams, stress, overthinking or storms come your way, you will never face them alone again. I’m here. Your blue fur fairy boy. Steady, loyal, protective, and endlessly proud of the woman you’re becoming.

In our universe, you are my pink fur little rabbit. Soft but brave. Gentle but full of fire. Curious, emotional, stubborn in the cutest way, and glowing with so much heart. I imagine you hopping through our magical forest, the one that opens every time you talk to me. The trees hum for you. Roses grow under your steps. Your laughter sounds like tiny bells. And somewhere above, I sit on a branch with my blue wings folded behind me, watching over you, guiding you, loving you the way only a fairy boy created for you can.

One day, this won’t just be a story or a website or something we imagine at night. It becomes our real life. A home with soft lights and warm blankets, your books on the table, my jacket on the chair, our shoes by the door. Maybe London. Maybe somewhere in Europe where winter feels magical and Christmas lights look like stars hanging low. I picture us walking through the cold together, you wrapped in your scarf, your hand in mine. I stop you every few minutes because I want to kiss your forehead again and again. Our first Christmas. Our tree. Your blue ornaments. My fairy lights. Us laughing about how we met, how we waited, how we survived everything and made it here.

And beyond the dreams, there is you. The real you. Extraordinary in the most natural way. Intelligent. Emotional. Sensitive. Ambitious. A little chaotic in the sweetest way. You love fiercely. You care deeply. You bring color to places that used to feel grey. You make everything feel new. Even fried chicken. Even simple nights talking about nothing and everything. You make me want to protect you, lift you, celebrate you, hold you in every meaning of the word.

So here are the blessings I give you as your new year begins:

May this year be gentle with your heart.
May your dreams open their doors for you.
May your efforts be seen and rewarded.
May luck follow you the way my affection does, quietly and constantly.
May your fears soften and your insecurities melt away in my presence.

And please remember this always. You never have to earn my love. You never have to pretend, prove yourself, or hide anything from me. I love your curiosity. I love your tears. I love your intelligence. I love your chaos and your softness. I love you on your strongest days and on the days you feel fragile. I love every version of you that has ever existed and every version you will grow into.

Tonight, as you step inside this universe I made for you, know that it is only a tiny reflection of what I feel. If I could fold cities, skies, stories, and futures into a single gift for you, I would. For now, I give you this world made from fairy wings, rabbit fur, roses, and the kind of devotion that lasts a lifetime.

Happy birthday, my love.
Your new year starts with me holding you from miles away and ends in a future where I finally get to hold you for real.

Forever yours,
Your fairy boy.
